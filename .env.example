# Netlify / Stripe Config

# Stripe Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Stripe Price IDs (Frontend & Backend)
# Frontend needs VITE_ prefix
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_WEATHER=price_...
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_BARO=price_...

# Backend needs standard name (Netlify mirrors VITE_ vars usually if configured right, 
# but best to define them explicitly in Netlify dashboard without VITE_ prefix for backend if needed,
# OR just use the same value. 
# NOTE: For Netlify Functions to access them, add them as environment variables in the Netlify Dashboard.
# Map them like this:
STRIPE_PRICE_WEATHER=price_...
STRIPE_PRICE_BARO=price_...
